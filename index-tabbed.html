          My name is Sean Bustard and I specialize in helping men and fathers rediscover their purpose and let go of limiting beliefs, even after finding stability and building families. Through the powerful tools of NLP and Matrix Therapies we're able to clear out negative emotions and influences and step into the power that resides within each of us.

          As a husband and father of 4, I understand that life can get chaotic and appear to be out of control. Let me assure you that even when life is like a tornado, you can always find the eye of the storm and that there is always a calm place to focus and set a plan into motion that will allow you to have more control over your life.

          I have overcome extreme challenges to get where I am today including an intensely dysfunctional childhood, a multitude of mental health issues and a 10 year drug addiction - all by rewiring and reworking my mindset and conquering the obstacles I am faced with.

          My previous experience in the work force as a salesman, customer service rep and construction lead have honed and polished my leadership and communication skills and I am confident that I can help you as well.

        <h3 class="section-headline">Removing Limiting Beliefs</h3>
        <p class="verbage">Our unconscious mind is programmed with limiting beliefs. These limiting beliefs serve a purpose within our unconscious mind and trigger our thought patterns and behaviors of self sabotage. We can eliminate these limiting beliefs and replace them with new, empowering beliefs that change our perception of previous mental blocks.</p>
